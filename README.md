# Audio-Reader
Audio Reader
Install Required Libraries:
tkinter for the GUI.
PyPDF2 for reading PDF files.
python-docx for reading Word documents.
pygame for playing audio files.
Design the GUI:

Create a Tkinter application with buttons to select PDF/Word documents and audio files.
Add buttons for actions like reading PDF/Word, playing audio, etc.
Use labels to display text and status updates.
Implement the Backend:

Create a class for handling PDF files. This class should have methods to extract text from PDF files.
Create another class for handling Word files. This class should have methods to extract text from Word files.
Implement a class for handling audio files. This class can use pygame to play audio files.
Integrate OOP Principles:

Use classes and objects to encapsulate functionality related to PDF, Word, and audio files.
Implement inheritance and polymorphism where applicable. For example, you can have a base class for file reading and specific subclasses for PDF and Word reading.
Connect GUI with Backend:

Define functions that will be called when buttons are clicked.
These functions should instantiate the appropriate classes and call their methods to perform actions like reading PDF/Word files and playing audio.
